# *Trident* CPU
## Description
I designed a Central Processing Unit (CPU) using Logisim Evolution with my knowledge from the Computer Architecture and Organization course. The project involved creating a functional assembler using Node.js to generate instruction memory from assembly files adhering to the ARMv8 instruction set architecture. ARMv8 is a 64-bit instruction set architecture that is commonly used in processors to define the set of operations and commands of a computer's CPU. The assembler I wrote served as a crucial bridge between human-readable assembly code and the machine-level language understood by the CPU. Through this project, I learned digital logic design using Logisim Evolution, the intricacies of CPU architecture, and the vital role of assemblers in the execution of instructions at the hardware level.
